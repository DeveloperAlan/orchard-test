Test Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------



Please supply a zip file containing the html and necessary files needed to build the webpage in the attached jpeg, please ensure it is able to run as a static html page. Please also ensure you implement the tree structure on the left hand side using JavaScript and jQuery.

Here at Orchard we support all major modern browsers including Internet Explorer from IE9+ so please bear that in mind when you are preparing your files. 

Our clients on the whole expect the design they signed off to be reproduced in their browser of choice. We know this isn't current best practice, and we communicate to our clients that a layout should be adapted to the device it's viewed on, but sometimes they just want what they paid for. 

For performance and maintenance sake and to lessen our headache, we'll slip in some progressive enhancement on none essential design elements if we can get away with it. ;) 
 


The supplied design shouldn't take much longer than an hour to code and will give us a good example of the way you like to work, it's your chance to stand out, show off your approach to building a great interface, and maybe teach us something along the way. 



Thanks,
